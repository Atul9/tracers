# Probing

This trait is translated at compile-time by `tracers` into a platform-specific tracing
provider, which allows very high-performance and low-overhead tracing of the probes it
fires.

The exact details of how to use interact with the probes depends on the underlying
probing implementation.

## SystemTap/USDT (Linux x64)

This trait corresponds to a SystemTap/USDT provider named `{provider_name}`,

# Probing

This method is translated at compile-time by `tracers` into a platform-specific tracing
probe, which allows very high-performance and low-overhead tracing.

## How to fire probe

To fire this probe, don't call this method directly. Instead, use the `probe!` macro, for example:

```ignore
// If the probe is enabled, fires the probe.  If the probe isn't enabled, or if provider
// initialization failed for some reason, does not fire the probe, and does NOT evaluate the
// arguments to the probe.
probe!({trait_name}::{probe_name}(...));
```

The exact details of how to interact with the probes depends on the underlying
probing implementation.

## SystemTap/USDT (Linux x64)

To trace the firing of this probe, use `bpftrace`, e.g.:
```text
sudo bpftrace -p ${{PID}} -e 'usdt::{provider}:{probe_name} {{ printf("Hello from {probe_name}\n"); }}'
```

where `${{PID}}` should be the actual process ID of the process you are tracing.
